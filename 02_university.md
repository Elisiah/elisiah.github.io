This page documents the projects I have undertaken at the University of Exeter.

<h3>Internship of Research in Interactive Theorem Proving</h3>
Under Dr. Diego Marmsoler of the University of Exeter - I, and 2 others, worked on creating a formalisation of many automata in Isabelle/HOL. The internship was funded by A2I (Access to Internships) and was an 8 week long project.

<h3>ExLean</h3>
ExLean is a project founded by Dr. Gihan Marasingha at the University of Exeter. It seeks to teach undergraduate students maths topics through the LEAN Interactive Theorem Prover in a way that enhances their understanding and intuition as well as developing their ability to deal with logic based problems. I am a founding member and admin: organising, taking part in and helping other students with Lean Weekly Work-togethers.

<h3>Exeter Mathematics Study and Support Group</h3>
Alongside Dr. Gihan Marasingha I am a founding member of the Exeter Mathematics Study and Support Group. I am responsible for the organisation and running of the discord server as well as the graphic design of the logo and upcoming events. The server seeks to be a central hub for students of Mathematics at Exeter to communicate and share knowledge as well as connecting them with lecturers and running regular events.

<h3>UoE Computer Science Society</h3>
During my time at the University of Exeter I was on the staff team of the Computer Science Society. I was responsible for the organisation and running of events as well as the graphic design of posters and social media posts.

During this time I also attended hackathons organised by the society, as well as playing for the society's football team.

This page documents the projects I have undertaken at the University of Exeter.

<h3><a href="/university/2022/07/01/exlean-project.html">ExLean</a></h3>
ExLean is a project founded by Dr. Gihan Marasingha at the University of Exeter. It seeks to teach undergraduate students maths topics through the LEAN Interactive Theorem Prover in a way that enhances their understanding and intuition as well as developing their ability to deal with logic based problems. I am a founding member and admin: organising, taking part in and helping other students with Lean Weekly Work-togethers.

<h3>Exeter Mathematics Study and Support Group</h3>
Alongside Dr. Gihan Marasingha I am a founding member of the Exeter Mathematics Study and Support Group. I am responsible for the organisation and running of the discord server as well as the graphic design of the logo and upcoming events. The server seeks to be a central hub for students of Mathematics at Exeter to communicate and share knowledge as well as connecting them with lecturers and running regular events.

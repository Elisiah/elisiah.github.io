Hi Im Ellie,<br>
Im a Second Year BSc Computer Science and Mathematics Undergraduate at the University of Exeter.

Please note that since alot of my work is reverse engineering alot of code I write I cannot post; find my GitHub in the footer.

<b>Here are my two main projects (Please click the title to go to their respective landing pages):</b>

<h1><a href="https://jumpkingplus.github.io/">Jump King Project</a></h1>

I work as a member of a small team of 4 called [Jump King Plus](https://jumpkingplus.github.io/)
 to create new updates for the game [Jump King](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1061090/Jump_King/).
The mod and updates are officially endorsed by Nexile (the creators of Jump King).

<h1><a href="/decomp/">N64 Decompilation Project</a></h1>

I also collaborate on the [Chameleon Twist Decompilation Project Github](https://github.com/chameleonTwistRet/),
which seeks to rewrite the assembly code of the Nintendo 64 games Chameleon Twist 1 and 2 as C code so they can be: modified;
understood and recompiled on other hardware.

This project has led to multiple offshoot projects including a [Blender Plugin](decompilation/2023/03/10/ctBlend) and a [Mod For The Game](decompilation/2022/11/12/mod) with a working menu. You can read about these [Here](/decomp/)

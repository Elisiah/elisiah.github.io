Hi Im Ellie,<br>
Im a Transgender, BSc Computer Science and Mathematics Undergraduate at the University of Exeter.

This is a site to endlessly talk about the projects I have been working on!

<h1><a href="/jumpking/">Jump King Project</a></h1>

I work as a member of a small team of 4 called [Jump King Plus](https://phoenixx19.github.io/JumpKingPlus/)
 to create new updates for the game [Jump King](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1061090/Jump_King/).
The mod and updates are officially endorsed by Nexile (the creators of Jump King). Our mod collection currently
has been downloaded over 20,000 times. JK+: ![](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/JumpKingPlus/JumpKingPlus/total?style=flat-square)

<h1><a href="/n64/">N64 Decompilation Project</a></h1>

I also collaborate on the [Chameleon Twist Decompilation Project](https://github.com/Elisiah/CTwist-Decomp-WIP),
which seeks to rewrite the assembly code of the Nintendo 64 game Chameleon Twist as C code so it can be: modified;
understood and recompiled on other hardware.

<h3>Super Monkey Ball BBHD Practice Mod (Page Not Built)</h3> 
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%23-brightgreen)

A modification of the game that implements new features to help speedrunners practice the game.

<b><i>Thanks to this mod SEGA gave me pre-release access to their newer game "SMB: Banana Mania" to create mods and tools.</i></b>

Extreme 3D is a n64 emulator memory reading script paired with a blender python plugin.
I developed it so that speedrunners of the game could watch their runs back in a 3D space from different camera angles and with path tracking, to help them find places to improve which may be missed given the games limited tools.

<h3><a href="/sideproject/2022/03/26/hollow-knight.html">Hollow Knight - Localize Cloud Saves Mod</a></h3> 
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%23-brightgreen)

A modified version of the Game Pass edition of the game that allows XBOX Cloud Saves to be downloaded and used / edited on PC. Usually the game pass version of the game is cloud only.

<h3>Super Monkey Ball PC Data Encrypt/Decrypter (Page Not Built)</h3>

I reverse engineered both games to find the key used in the decryption and encryption algorithms. I then implemented these algorithms in C# to allow users to decrypt and encrypt their own save files.

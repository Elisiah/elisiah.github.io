This page is to show some smaller side projects I work on with a brief description and a link to a blog post that will go more in detail.

<h3><a href="/sideproject/2022/03/26/extreme-3d.html">Extreme-3D</a></h3>
Extreme 3D is a n64 emulator memory reading script paired with a blender python plugin.
I developed it so that speedrunners of the game could watch their runs back in a 3D space from different camera angles and with path tracking, to help them find places to improve which may be missed given the games limited tools.

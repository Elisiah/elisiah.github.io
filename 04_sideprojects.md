This page is to show some smaller side projects I work on with a brief description and a link to a blog post that will go more in detail.

<h3><a href="/sideproject/2022/03/26/extreme-3d.html">Extreme-3D</a></h3>
Extreme 3D is a n64 emulator memory reading script paired with a blender python plugin.
I developed it so that speedrunners of the game could watch their runs back in a 3D space from different camera angles and with path tracking, to help them find places to improve which may be missed given the games limited tools.

<h3>ExLean</h3>
ExLean is a project founded by Gihan Marasingha at the University of Exeter. It seeks to teach undergraduate students maths topics through the LEAN Interactive Theorem Prover in a way that enhances their understanding and intuition as well as developing their ability to deal with logic based problems. I am a founding member and admin: organising, taking part in and helping other students with Lean Weekly Work-togethers.
